# carbon_intensity

A new Flutter project.


This project, Carbon Buddy, dynamically displays the UK's carbon intensity data using a graph that updates in real time. It fetches data from the Carbon Intensity API and plots half-hourly carbon intensity values for the current day.

The app is built with Flutter, focusing on Android devices for optimal performance and UI compatibility.
